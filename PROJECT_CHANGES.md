# AquaSmart Project Update - Summary of Changes


## Overview
We have successfully built a new **Data Entry System** for AquaSmart. This update makes it easy for you to record daily farm activities and manage your farm's data in one place.

## Key Features We Added

### 1. New Data Entry Dashboard
- **One Central Hub**: A dedicated page for all your data recording needs.
- **Easy Navigation**: A simple menu on the left lets you quickly switch between different forms (Mortality, Feeding, Harvest, etc.).

### 2. Manage Your Systems (Cages, Ponds, Tanks)
- **Create New Systems**: You can now register new cages, ponds, or tanks directly from the app.
- **Automatic Updates**: When you add a new system (like "Cage 101"), it instantly appears in all other forms so you can start using it right away.

### 3. Recording Daily Activities
We created easy-to-use forms for all your daily tasks. expected:
- **Mortality**: Log daily fish counts.
- **Feeding**: Record what and how much you fed.
- **Stocking**: Add new batches of fish to your systems.
- **Transfer**: Move fish from one system to another.
- **Harvest**: Record your final catch.
- **Water Quality**: Log temperature, oxygen levels, etc.

### 4. Instant Feedback
- **Recent Entries list**: As soon as you save a record, it appears in a list at the bottom of the page. This lets you confirm that your data was saved correctly.
- **Live Dropdowns**: When you need to select a system (e.g., for Feeding), the list is always up-to-date with your latest changes.

### 5. Secure Authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: We implemented a secure login system. This means different users (like Admins or Farm Managers) can have different permissions.
- **Data Protection**: Your data is protected so that only authorized users can access or change it.
